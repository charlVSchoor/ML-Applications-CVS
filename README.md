# ML-Applications-CVS
This repository contains the source files, datasets and paper scripts in fulfilment for the requirements of the course: Seminar: Crucial Topics in Information Management - Machine Learning Applications in the Context of Digital Transformation


## Requirements for operation:

Rstudio programming software - latest version available at https://www.rstudio.com
	Packages:
		You will find a description of the required libraries, and how to download them, in 0_main.R.




Python software - preferably the latest
	Packages:
		TensorFlow
		Keras
		TensorBoard



## A brief overview of the repo:

The repo consists of five directories, of which the source (src) directory is the most important; it contains all of the empirical work done for this paper. 

To execute the source files you need R and Python installed. After installation, open 0_main.R, uncomment the packages for installation, and run the script line for line.

This should execute file 1_saveProductTopicDistrubtions.R to 4_GLM.R. If this does not work, execute each script separately. Because of comparability issues between versions, execute the 5_NN.py script in Python separately. Explore the src folder to see the results.
