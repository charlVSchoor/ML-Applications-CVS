\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
\label{sec:conclusion}


Future work:
find a different, preferably a sequential dataset to have RNN. Use the wiki situation but spend more time removing stop words
specify a different predicted variable to detect whether consumer is utilitarian or hedonic 
Try to use a different measurement to relate consumer purchases with topics 
Use validation processes by having more computational power
Test other models than just NN for prediction 
more research into neural networks for optimal prediction, as the increases in prediction accuracy was not much
